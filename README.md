Part 1: Getting Started
===========

1. Create a new rails application called "SimpleQuotes" and initialize a blank git repository inside the app:

        rails new SimpleQuotes
        cd SimpleQuotes
        git init .

1. Add all the files generated by rails to the repo and verify that all files are staged with the command `git status`. Commit these files by typing to git and verify again with `git status`.

        git add .
        git commit -m 'Base rails app'


1. Checkout a new branch called "quote". We will merge this back into `master` later.

        git checkout -b quote

1. Create the `Quote` model and scaffolding using the rails generator. (Substitute the correct values):

        rails generate scaffold <Model> <attribute>:<data type>

    Your model should be `Quote`, with `body:string` and `source:string`. When generating the scaffold, multiple attributes (with colon and data type) are separated by a single space.

1. Visit the [Rails API documentation](http://apidock.com) from your browser for reference.

1. Open your rails project in your preferred editor.

1. Open the `config/database.yml` file and change the name of the development database to match the following:

    ```yaml
    development:
      # ... other stuff
      database: db/quotes_dev.sqlite3
    ```

    **Do not change anything else in the file!**

1. Go to the `db/migrate` directory and verify there is a file named `<somenumber>_create_quotes.rb`. Open this file and make sure the content is accurate.

    Set the default value of `source` to "Anonymous".  To do this, change the line with `:source` to

    ```ruby
    t.string :source, default: "Anonymous"
    ```

1. Migrate the database:

        rails db:migrate

1. Commit your work with git. First type `git status` to see what needs to be staged. You will notice that in addition to the `config/database.yml` change you made, rails automatically edited your `routes.rb` file to include routing information for the new model you created.

        git status

    In addition, there are a number of new files related to the quotes scaffolding that need to be added to the project. Since these are all related, we will add them all at once to the staging level with `git add .`. 

        git add .

    Now commit these changes from staging to the repository by typing. Type git log to see a history of the repository changes.

        git commit -m "Quote model scaffolded; db minor edits"

1. Start up the development web server.

        rails server

1. Open up your browser and go to [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) to view the application.  

1. Add a `/quotes` to the end of the URL to get to the main quotes page.

1. Use the web ui to enter in at least three quotes from the [famous quotes database](). Update one quote. Destroy one quote.

1. Now that the basic CRUD functionality is working and the app is populated with test data, let's merge it back to the master branch. 

        git checkout master
        git merge quote

Show a TA that you have the Rails app set up, that the CRUD functionality of the app is working, and have properly saved the code to git. Make sure the TA initials your sheet.

Part 2: Model, View, and Controller
===========

1. Create a new git branch called 'home' and check out the code to that branch.

        git checkout -b home

1. Downloand and add the image `quips_n_quotes.png` (available in this repo) to your `app/assets/images` directory.

1. Now we want to edit the application layout (`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`).

    Use the following as a template to get you started. Make sure to look at the API documentation before asking a TA for help.
  

        <html>
          <head>
            <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
            <title>Quips and Quotes :: <%= controller.controller_name.capitalize %></title>
            <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
      
            <!-- #stylesheet: add my_styles using rails helper function# -->

            <%= javascript_include_tag 'application' %>
            <%= csrf_meta_tag %>
          </head>

          <body>
            <div id="wrap">
              <div id="header">
                <%= link_to(image_tag('quips_n_quotes.png'), home_path) %>
               </div>
               <br />

               <div id="body">
                 <%= yield %>
               </div>

               <!-- #footer partial should go here later (but not yet...)# -->

            </div>
          </body>
        </html>


1. Make sure Rails can find the new home page by adding the code below to the `config/routes.rb` file.  Add this code right after the `resources :quotes` line.  (You can delete the comments after you read them and clean up the file as well.) 

    ```ruby
    resources :quotes

    get 'home' => 'home#index', as: :home
    root to: 'home#index'
    ```

1. Promote these changes to the staging level in git and then commit them to the repository's home branch.

1. Start the rails server and in browser click on the logo at the top of the page.

    Solve this error on your own.  (Just kidding ...)

    The problem is that the layout references a 'home_path'  to a controller that we have not yet created.

1. Now we can create a home controller with an index action:

    ```bash
       rails generate controller Home index
    ```

    This will create a controller called 'home_controller' with an index action as well as the associated view.

1. Open the `Quote` model in `app/models/quote.rb` and add in the method `get_random_quote` below.  

    
    ```ruby
    # Method to get a random quote for home page
    # 
    # @return [Quote]
    #   the random quote 
    def self.get_random_quote
      self.all.to_a[rand(self.all.length)]
    end
    ```

1. You might have discovered that the random function is incorrect, since would generate a random number that might be up to the index of the length, which would be out of bounds. You can quickly fix it as follows if you haven't already.

    ```ruby
    # Method to get a random quote for home page
    # 
    # @return [Quote]
    #   the random quote 
    def self.get_random_quote
      self.all.to_a[rand(self.all.length) - 1]
    end
    ```

1. What's even better, as it turns out you don't even need to generate the number yourself. In fact, Rails provides us with the useful function select, which gets a random element from a relation. Great! You can just replace the inside of the method with the following:

    ```ruby
      self.all.sample
    ```

1. Let's also add some validations to make sure that all quotes have a source and a body. Add the following code to the quotes model, before get_random_quote method:
    
    ```ruby
      validates_presence_of :body
      validates_presence_of :source
    ```


1. Now, let's open the `home` controller in `app/controllers` and add a new random quote to the `index` action by adding the following line to the index method:

    ```ruby
       @quote = Quote.get_random_quote
    ```

1. Replace the generic contents of `app/views/home/index.html.erb` with the sample code below.  Of course, replace each of the commented erb tags (`<%= %>`) with either the `body` or the `source` of the quote we got in the `home` controller. Hint: this can be accessed by `@quote.<field_name>`:

    ```erb
    <p>This site is an eclectic set of (somewhat) famous quotes. Today's quote of the day is as follows:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h1><%= # QUOTE BODY GOES HERE %></h1><br>

    <h2><%= # SOURCE GOES HERE %></h2>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <%= link_to 'Add a new quote to our list', new_quote_path %>
    ```

1. Commit all these changes to git.

1. Restart the web server and view the site. Reload the home page several times to see new quotes appear.

1. Add new quotes (try once to skip the body and see the error message that is given) in the quotes section.

1. Finally, it's time to add a statement of ownership to the footer of every page.

    In the `app/views` directory create a new directory called `partials`.

1. Create a new file in that directory called `_footer.html.erb` and add the contents shown below.  

    ```erb
    <div id="footer">
      <div id="copy">
        Webmaster: <%= # your mail_to link goes here; encode with javascript %> 
        Copyright &copy; 2016
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

    Note that you need to edit the [mail_to link](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper/mail_to) so that it displays your name, references your email address and is encoded with Javascript (to prevent spammers from harvesting it).

1. Go to the `application.html.erb` file in the layouts directory and replace the #footer partial# comment with an erb tag that renders the partial footer you just created.

      ```ruby
      <%= render partial: 'partials/footer' %>
      ```

    Note that we don't include the `_` (underscore) or extension (`.html.erb`).

1. Restart the rails application and view your footer. Make sure your name links to your email address.

1. Now we need to merge these changes onto the master branch. Switch back to the master branch now.  Using the command `git merge home` to pull the contents of the home branch into the master branch.  

        git checkout master
        git merge home

Show a TA that your website is working, has a footer and random quote, and that you have committed your changes to git. Make sure the TA initials your sheet.

<!--
Part 4: Submitting to a Remote Repository
==========
There is a great tutorial online for using remote repositories that I encourage you to check out later at [atlassian.com](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/remote-repositories).  Our goal here is to get you to submit a project to a remote repository today so we know you are prepared to do so when we start phase 2.  We will be submitting the lab you finished and have stored in a local git repository.

1. Go to [http://darkknight.hss.cmu.edu/users/password/new](http://darkknight.hss.cmu.edu/users/password/new) and type in your andrew email address (e.g. andrewid@andrew.cmu.edu). Check your Andrew Email and you should see an link to reset your DarkKnight password. Once you have done that login with your new password. Ask a TA if you need help.

2. You will have to upload your SSH key to the gitlab server.  There is a [document](http://67272.cmuis.net/files/67272/GitLab_Instructions.pdf) that will walk you through this process and TAs can help you with this as well.   (_As you go through this tutorial, please remember that you are not Sally User, so replace 'suser' with your own Andrew ID._)

3. Once your key is saved to gitlab, switch to the home directory of your project.  Be sure this is where your git repository is by typing `ls -a` and seeing that you have a hidden `.git` directory there.

4. Verify that you currently have no remote repository specified by typing `git remote -v`.  The -v flag tells us to be verbose and print out the remote url, if it exists.  You should get no results from this command.

5. Add a connection to the remote repository called 'origin' by typing the command below (replacing your Andrew ID where appropriate).  The reason this is phase_1.git is that this portion of the lab counts as credit for part of Phase 1.

  ```bash
  git remote add origin git@darkknight.hss.cmu.edu:YOURANDREWID/SimpleQuotes.git
  ```

6. Verify that the connection to the remote repository exists by retyping `git remote -v`.  Now you should see two urls listed for origin -- one to push and the other to fetch.

7. Push your code out to the remote repository with the command:

  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ```

8. Go to [darkknight.hss.cmu.edu](http://darkknight.hss.cmu.edu/) and verify your project and all its files are in the remote repository.

Part 3: Additional Views
===========

__Note: If you are out of time, you may finish this last part outside of lab. You will get full credit for this lab.__

1. Go to the command line and create a new git branch called 'styling' and check out the code to that branch so we can experiment with some new styles.

        git checkout -b styling
        
1. Download and add the `my_styles.css` file to your `app/assets/stylesheets` directory.

1. Edit the `my_styles.css` stylesheet so that the base font is Verdana and font-size is 14px:

    ```css
    html, body {
      font-family: Verdana;
      font-size: 14px;
    }
    ```
    
1. Edit the `h1` tags display text in bold and at a font-size 180% of the base size:

    ```css
    h1 {
      font-size: 180%;
      line-height: 1.5;
    }
    ```
    
1. When we restart the server, we see the correct information displayed on `home/index`, but no styling or image can be seen. That’s because we have not yet inserted the stylesheet tags in our application layout file, which is `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`. Add this code in place of the stylesheet comment: 

    ```erb
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "my_styles.css" %>
    ```

1. Also add this line of code at the bottom of `config/initializers/assets.rb`: 
 
    ```erb
    Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( my_styles.css )
    ```
  
1. Restart rails server to see the new styling. 

1. Commit to git.

- - -
# <span class="mega-icon mega-icon-issue-opened"></span> Stop
Show a TA that your rails application has additional styling. Make sure the TA initials your sheet.

<!--Part 4: SQLite Practice
===========

__Note: If you are out of time, you may finish this last part outside of lab. You will get full credit for this lab.__

1. Now we will practice interacting with the database directly. Using the SQLite Manager in Firefox, [Base](http://menial.co.uk/base/), or the command line, open the `db/quotes_dev.sqlite3` database. 

    If you want to use the command line, you can type `rails db` as a shortcut to open the database. Typing `.quit` will return you to the command line. Typing `.mode column` and `.header on` will make the output more readable.

1. Experiment with the interface by adding, deleting and searching for quotes using SQL. When you are ready, demonstrate to a TA that you can perform all three of these operations in SQLite Manager or on the command line.

- - -
# <span class="mega-icon mega-icon-issue-opened"></span> Stop
Show a TA that you can work with a sqlite3 database. Make sure the TA initials your sheet. You are now finished with the lab.
